# Stellar and Galactic object classification
Classify stellar and galactic objects such as stars, galaxies, or quasars using photometric and spectral data by leveraging classical machine learning (ML).

## Objective
We will classify stellar and galactic bodies using spectral and photometric data and utilizing classical machine learning (ML) models for predictive classification using the collected data points. Further, we will also apply feature importance analysis to interpret which features drive the classification.

* **Goal**: Predictive classification
